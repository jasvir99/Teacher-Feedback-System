\subsection{Quality Characteristics}
\begin{itemize}
    \item{\bf Efficiency}
	The application will make use of mathematical functions for proper
	evaluation of the feedback, to provide efficient results.

    \item{\bf Correctness}
	For the correctness of this software, the objective is first clearly 
	defined in previous sections. Modules have been used as much as 
	possible, making it easy to understand, maintain and for any kind of future testing.

    \item{\bf Integrity/Security}
	The use of login accounts makes the software accessible only to authorized users. 

    \item{\bf Flexibility}
	 The Modular approach makes it flexible to changes for improvements.

    \item{\bf Reusability}
	 With a generalised approach, the software can be used for feedbacks 
	in other organisations as well.

\end{itemize}
